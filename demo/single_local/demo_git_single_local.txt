# git demo. Single developer and local repository.

# First we move to a safe place:
cd /tmp/

# Run git. It's harmless :-)
git

# Ask git what it knows about the current directory its parent
# directories:
git status

# Introduce yourself to git:
git config --global user.name "Emanuele Olivetti"
git config --global user.email "olivetti@fbk.eu"

# ... and check it:
git config user.name
git config user.email
git config -l

# Create a directory where to do version control and enter it:
mkdir /tmp/demo_git_single_local
cd /tmp/demo_git_single_local

# Create the git repository within the current directory:
git init
# Verify that you have a brand new ".git/" directory:
ls -al .
# ...full of interesting things...:
ls -al .git/
# Ask git about the current directory:
git status

# Create a file named hello.py 
echo "print 'hello.'" > hello.py

# ...check the status:
git status

# and then put hello.py under git VC.
# First add hello.py to the staging area:
git add hello.py
# Check how the status changes:
git status

# Now record changes to the master database:
git commit -m "My first commit. A big step for the mankind."

# Check the status again, it is instructive:
git status

# Edit hello.py some more:
echo "import numpy as np" >> hello.py
echo "print np.random.rand(3)" >> hello.py

# See how the status changes accordingly:
git status

# show changes between current files and staged files:
git diff

# Add changes into the staging area (index):
git add hello.py
# and see how the status changes accordingly:
git status

# Edit again hello.py
echo "print np.eye(4)" >> hello.py

# Commit the changes from the staging area (only):
git commit -m "Added printout of 3 random numbers."

# Verify that changes not added to the staging area were not recorded:
git diff

# Commit all changes of hello.py skipping the staging area step:
git commit hello.py -m "Added beautiful eyes."

# Edit hello.py again and create more files:
echo "print np.subtract.outer(np.random.rand(3),np.random.rand(2))" >> hello.py
echo "import time" > clock.py
echo "print time.ctime()" >> clock.py

# inspect changes before commits:
git status
git diff

# commit all changes made in all files skipping staging area:
git add clock.py
git commit -a -m "Added a Swiss clock and improved hello.py."

# See the logs of all commits:
git log

# See the logs of all commits with the git GUI:
gitk

# Get crazy and mess with your files:
echo "printttt 'I hate you...'" > hello.py
rm clock.py

# Oh no! What I've done! Shame on me!
git status
git diff
# Relax buddy... you are using git :-)
# Get rid of the last untracked changes:
git checkout .
ls
git status
git diff
