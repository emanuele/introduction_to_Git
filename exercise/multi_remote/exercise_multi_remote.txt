# git exercise. Multiple developers and one remote shared repository.

# Instructions: below you can find a list of steps you are requested
# to follow using a shell and issuing the appropriate git
# commands. You are requested to write down those same commands within
# this text file just after each instruction item. This will help you
# to keep track of what you did and to discuss with tutors. This file
# is a helpful place where to store your comments and notes about the
# exercise.

##############################################
# Scenario 2a : "user of a remote repository". 
##############################################

# In this scenario you are just users of a remote repository where one
# or more developers push the code.

# Clone the git repository 
# https://github.com/emanuele/git-exercise.git

git clone https://github.com/emanuele/git-exercise.git

# Enter the 'git-exercise' directory and check the status of the
# repository "git-exercise".

cd git-exercise
git status

# Ask git about the URL of the remote repository.

git remote -v

# Read and execute social_network.py to understand what it does.

cat social_network.py
python social_network.py

# From time to time new code is pushed by developers towards the
# remote shared repository. You want to fetch these updates to your
# local repository. (This might not happen in this very moment, but
# keep your fingers crossed or try fetching multiple times).

git fetch

# Inspect how the logs changes accordingly.

git log

# See the logs from the graphical interface. It is more instructive if
# you see all possible branches (hint: use "--all" flag).

gitk --all

# Merge the updates within your working tree. Hint: you might need to
# specify "origin/master" to indicate from where to retrieve updates.

git merge origin/master

# Inspect how the logs changes accordingly.

git log

# Execute the script social_network.py again to see the effects of
# the latest updates.

python social_network.py

# See what changed after merging, from the graphical interface.

gitk --all

# Go back to the previous commit. Hint: the last commit is called
# HEAD, the last but one HEAD~1, then HEAD~2, etc.

git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Verify that the last updates are not in the logs anymore.

git log

# Verify that the last updates are not merged. Use the graphical
# interface.

gitk --all

# Pull the latest changes and merge them immediately

git pull

# Verify that merge succeeded from the graphical interface.

gitk --all

# Verify that the logs show the latest pull.

git log

# Scenario 2b: "local developer of a remote project"
######################################################

# Task 1: create a new file within the directory "people/" called
# after your name and surname: <name.surname>.txt . Within that file
# write a short list of people you know (other students, lecturers,
# friends, family etc.)  one name per line in the form of 
# "name surname".

# Execute social_network.py and check that it correctly shows the
# information that you have just provided.

python social_network.py

# Add your new file people/<name.surname.txt> to the staging area.

git add people/emanuele.olivetti.txt

# Commit changes in the staging area.

git commit -m "Added Emanuele."

# Check how the log changes accordingly, both from the shell command
# and the graphical interface.

git log
gitk --all

####################################################
# Scenario 2c: "from local developer to contributor"
####################################################

# You want to share your recent changes with other developers. So now
# you push them remotely. WARNING: the remote repository could have
# recent updates from other developers that you do not have yet, so
# your push attempt might fail. In that case you need to pull
# first. But it instructive to try to push first and see the error.

git push # an error is expected here!
git pull
git push

# See how the logs of all branches (-all) reflects your push.

gitk --all


#########################
# Scenario 2d: conflicts!
#########################

# Task 2: you want to add a new feature to the social network graph: a
# better title. Edit social_network.py and improve the title of the
# graph.

emacs social_network.py

# Execute social_network.py to verify that your code works well.

python social_network.py

# Commit changes to your local repository.

git commit social_network.py -m "Added cool title."

# Pull from the remote repository before pushing.

git pull

# WARNING: a conflict could raise. Resolve it by editing the
# appropriate file. Then add and commit the change to resolve the
# conflict.

emacs social_network.py
python social_network.py
git add social_network.py
git commit -m "Fixed conflicting titles."

# Try again to send your changes to the other developers.

git pull
git push
